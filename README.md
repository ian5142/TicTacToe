Tic-Tac-Toe
===========

A Tic Tac Toe GUI program written in Java. It is either 2 player or single player. For single player, you can play against one of three diffculties: Easy, Medium, or Hard. On easy the computer just guessing randomly. For medium, the computer will block, but it is still possible to win. On hard, the computer will block and will win almost every game. 

When the program is run it will ask if you want to start a one or two player game. If a one player game is selected, then the text file "users.txt" is read and if your username is found the stats are set to what they were when you last played, if not they are all zero.

Enjoy.
There is no warranty and I may not be able to provide support because I am just learning how to program. 
Thanks
